Dependency Injection container. Here are the key components:

Container Structure:

goCopytype Container struct {
    mu              sync.RWMutex              // Thread safety
    services        map[string]*ScopedService // Stores services with their scopes
    log             *zap.SugaredLogger        // Logging
    lifecycleManager *LifecycleManager        // Manages service lifecycles
    profileManager   *ProfileManager          // Manages environment profiles
    aspectManager    *aop.AspectManager       // Handles aspect-oriented programming
    parent          *Container                // Hierarchical DI support
}

Key Features:

a) Service Registration:
goCopyfunc (c *Container) Register(qualifier string, service interface{}, scope Scope) error {
    // Registers a service with specific scope (Singleton/Prototype)
    // Handles lifecycle hooks (PostConstruct) for Singletons
    // Validates service registration
}
b) Service Resolution:
goCopyfunc (c *Container) Resolve(qualifier string) (interface{}, error) {
    // Resolves services based on their scope:
    // - Singleton: Returns same instance
    // - Prototype: Creates new instance
    // - Supports hierarchical lookup (parent containers)
}
c) Dependency Injection:
goCopyfunc (c *Container) InjectStruct(target interface{}) error {
    // Injects dependencies into struct fields marked with "di" tags
    // Handles required vs optional dependencies
    // Performs type compatibility checks
    // Executes lifecycle hooks after injection
}

Advanced Features:

a) Profile Management:
goCopyfunc (c *Container) SetActiveProfiles(profiles ...string)
func (c *Container) IsProfileActive(profileName string) bool

Manages different environment profiles (dev, prod, etc.)
Conditional bean creation based on profiles

b) Aspect-Oriented Programming:
goCopyfunc (c *Container) AddAspect(aspect aop.Aspect)
func (c *Container) ExecuteAspects(jp *aop.JoinPoint) error

Supports cross-cutting concerns (logging, metrics, etc.)
Different aspect types (Before, After, Around, etc.)

c) Lifecycle Management:
goCopyfunc (c *Container) Cleanup() error {
    // Executes PreDestroy hooks
    // Cleans up resources
    // Handles graceful shutdown
}

Usage Example:

goCopy// Create container
container := NewContainer()

// Register service
container.Register("userService", NewUserService(), Singleton)

// Inject dependencies
injectable := &MyStruct{}
container.InjectStruct(injectable)

// Use profiles
container.SetActiveProfiles("dev", "local")

// Add aspects
container.AddAspect(loggingAspect)

// Cleanup
defer container.Cleanup()

Key Benefits:


Thread-safe operations
Multiple scopes support (Singleton/Prototype)
Lifecycle management
Profile-based configuration
Aspect-oriented programming
Hierarchical DI
Comprehensive logging
Error handling
Resource cleanup

This container provides a full-featured dependency injection framework similar to Spring in Java, supporting:

Dependency management
Scope handling
Lifecycle hooks
Profile-based configuration
Aspect-oriented programming
Resource cleanup
Hierarchical containers

The implementation is thread-safe and provides extensive logging for debugging and monitoring.

Imagine you're playing with LEGO blocks:

The Container (Like a LEGO Box)

goCopytype Container struct {
    services map[string]*ScopedService  // Like shelves in your LEGO box
    // ... other stuff
}

It's like a special box where you keep all your toys (services)
Each toy has a name tag (qualifier) so you can find it easily


Registration (Putting Toys in the Box)

goCopyfunc (c *Container) Register(qualifier string, service interface{}, scope Scope)
This is like:

"Hey box, here's my toy car üöó"
"Please put it on the shelf called 'carService'"
"And remember if it's a sharing toy (Singleton) or personal toy (Prototype)"


Resolving (Getting Toys Out)

goCopyfunc (c *Container) Resolve(qualifier string)
This is like:

"Box, can I have my toy car please?"
The box looks for "carService" and gives you your car


Injection (Connecting Toys)

goCopyfunc (c *Container) InjectStruct(target interface{})
Like when you're building a LEGO set:

You have instructions that say "put the red block here"
The container reads these instructions (di tags)
It puts the right pieces (services) in the right spots


Real Example:

goCopy// Create toy box
container := NewContainer()

// Put toys in box
container.Register("car", NewToyCar(), Singleton)      // Sharing toy
container.Register("blocks", NewBlocks(), Prototype)   // Personal toy

// Build something with the toys
myToys := &ToySet{}
container.InjectStruct(myToys)  // Container helps put toys together

Special Features:

a) Scopes (Toy Rules):

Singleton: Like a sharing toy everyone uses
Prototype: Like personal toys - each kid gets their own

b) Profiles (Play Modes):
goCopycontainer.SetActiveProfiles("indoor", "rainy-day")

Like having different rules for playing inside vs outside

c) Aspects (Play Supervisors):
goCopycontainer.AddAspect(safetyChecker)

Like having a grown-up watch how toys are being used
Makes sure toys are used safely


Cleanup (Tidying Up):

goCopycontainer.Cleanup()

Like when mom says "time to put your toys away!"
Makes sure everything goes back in its place

In Real Terms:

Instead of toys, we're managing things like:

Database connections üíæ
User services üë•
Email senders ‚úâÔ∏è


The container makes sure:

Everything is organized
Things are connected properly
Resources are used correctly
Cleanup happens when we're done



It's like having a really smart toy box that:

Knows where everything is
Helps put things together
Makes sure toys are shared properly
Helps clean up when you're done
Makes sure everything is used safely

And just like having a responsible adult supervise playtime, it:

Keeps track of everything (logging)
Prevents fights over toys (thread safety)
Makes sure toys are used correctly (type safety)
Helps clean up messes (resource management)
